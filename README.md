# DesignLab
This is our project for course DesignLab in Electronics and Telecommunications studies. We would like to make a drone, using SpeedyBee F405V3 BLS50A 30x30 Stack, which provides us with FC (Flight Controller) and ESC (Electronic Speed Controller). We also want to use a QAV250 frame, 3S LiPo 2200 mAh battery, 4x 2300 kV brushless motors and 5 inches proppelers. All those componentes are used for construction and electronics. The Wi-Fi module and Android application will be responsible for control.
